# Overview
Welcome to the Blender to DAGMC Converter Plugin! This plugin allows you to convert your Blender 3D models into DAGMC (Direct Accelerated Geometry Monte Carlo) enabled geometry. With this, you can easily prepare your 3D models for Monte Carlo simulations.

DAGMC is a toolkit for enabling Monte Carlo particle transport simulations on complex 3D geometries. This plugin simplifies the process of converting Blender models into a format compatible with DAGMC, facilitating the seamless integration of 3D modeling and simulation workflows.
